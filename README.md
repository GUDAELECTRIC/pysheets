# PySheets

PySheets is a spreadsheet UI for Python, implemented in Python, running logic and saving data in the browser, using PyScript and IndexedDB.

# Licensing

Ahead In The Cloud Computing makes PySheets available under both the GPLv3 and a
[commercial license](https://buy.stripe.com/00g1684SS2BZ9Es7st).

If you want to self-host PySheets for personal projects or evaluation purposes, the GPLv3 licence applies. 
This licence allows free use of the software, but also implies that if you make any modifications or
extensions to PySheets, you need to share those changes yourself, under the same license. 

Self-hosting installations of PySheets that want to use the software but do not want to be subject to the GPL and
do not want to release the source code for their proprietary extensions and addons should purchase a
[commercial license](https://buy.stripe.com/00g1684SS2BZ9Es7st)
from Ahead In The Cloud Computing. Purchasing a commercial license means that the GPL does not apply, and a commercial 
license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements.

When using PySheets for any commercial purpose, we recommend a [commercial license](https://buy.stripe.com/00g1684SS2BZ9Es7st).
Commercial use includes incorporating PySheets into a commercial product, 
using PySheets in any commercial service, 
leveraging PySheets to create algorithms or workflows that aim to produce a profit,
using PySheets in a commercial, financial institution such as a bank or hedge fund,
or using PySheets to produce other artefacts for commercial purposes.



  
# Installation

To install PySheets on your local machine, run:

```
pip install pysheets-app
```

Do not install `pysheets`, this is an unrelated dormant project.

# Using

To run PySheets locally on your own machine, storing all data in the browser, without any server, run:

```
pysheets
```

This should open http://localhost:8081/ in your browser and show a button to create a new sheet.

Things to try:
 - Change the sheet name
 - Add literal values in the sheet
 - Import a sheet from the web (see the AI section)
